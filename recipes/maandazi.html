    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Mandazi, is a form of fried bread that originated on the Swahili Coast.
         It is also known as bofrot or puff puff in
    Western African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria.</p>
    <p>It is one of the principal dishes in the cuisine of the Swahili people 
        who inhabit the Coastal Region of Kenya and
    Tanzania</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup fine white sugar</li>
        <li>1 medium egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>3½ cups all-purpose flour, sifted</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine milk, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, sugar, egg, instant yeast, salt, and 
            cardamom in a large bowl. Mix in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough comes 
            together and is easily handled. Knead dough on a flat work surface until no longer sticky.
        </li>

        <li>Put dough back in the bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm area until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Press dough down gently. Knead it briefly and divide it into 4 portions. Roll each portion into a ball; keep covered
            with a cloth to prevent them from drying out.</li>


        <li>Roll 1 ball into a 1/3-inch-thick circle on a floured work surface. Cut into 4 triangles using a pizza cutter. Repeat
        with remaining balls of dough, keeping other dough covered.</li>

        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan over medium heat. Fry dough triangles 3 or 4 at a time, without overcrowding,
        until puffed like balloons, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn and continue frying until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes more. Drain on
        paper towels. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>

    </ol>
